# Privacy Policy for SwiftShift

**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026

## 1. General Overview
SwiftShift is a browser extension developed for personal use and shared with the community. It allows users to send web content (text, links, and images) to their own Telegram channels/groups. We prioritize your privacy and follow a "zero data collection" policy.

## 2. Information Collection and Use
SwiftShift **does not collect, store, or transmit** your personal data to any external servers, third parties, or the developer.
*   **Telegram Bot Token:** Your Bot Token is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`). It is used only to authenticate with the official Telegram Bot API to send your content.
*   **Content:** Any text, image, or URL you send via SwiftShift is transmitted directly from your browser to Telegram's official servers. No intermediary servers are involved.
*   **Browsing History:** SwiftShift does not track your browsing history or monitor your activity on websites. It only activates its permissions when you explicitly interact with the extension.

## 3. Data Storage
All extension data, including your target channels and recently sent items, are stored **locally on your device**. You can clear this data at any time by:
1.  Using the "Clear History" or "Logout" buttons within the extension.
2.  Uninstalling the extension, which automatically removes all locally stored data.

## 4. Third-Party Services
SwiftShift interacts with the **Telegram Bot API**. We encourage users to review Telegram's Privacy Policy to understand how their data is handled once it reaches Telegram's infrastructure.

## 5. Security
We take the security of your Bot Token seriously. Since it is stored locally, its security depends on your device's security. We recommend not sharing your Bot Token with anyone.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.

## 7. Contact
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you can reach out via the official project repository.
